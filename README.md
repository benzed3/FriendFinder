# FriendFinder

###FriendFinder is a dating/friend making app that matches you with someone based on a set of 10 questions.
###The app scores the results of the questionaire, and matches you with someone with similar score.
###The results will return with a picture and name of the closest match.
###Any questions and/or help about the app, contact me (Edward Benitez) at benzed3@gmail.com



#####The app is not complete. The final results are unfinished. I was planning on using forloops to add up the scores, add those to variables, and use if statments to find the closest match. The modal pop up would be filled using jquery in reference the json information of the closest match.
